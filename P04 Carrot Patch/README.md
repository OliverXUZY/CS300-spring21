# P04 Carrot Patch
I learned inheritance between classes, implementing interfaces in zybook5. This project mainly:
- Create several classes and derived classes.
- Implement interfaces and override methods.
- Casting objects.

I suffered a bit writing them since it's tedious and long. But I gained much fun when it finished.
