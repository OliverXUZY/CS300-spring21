# CS300-spring21
Java programming along with data structure.

Textbook: [zybook](https://learn.zybooks.com/zybook/WISCCOMPSCI300Spring2021)

Topics include (Update weekly):

- Getting Started with Java Programming: We'll first review  the Java syntax and then learn how to use objects in Java (Arrays, ArrayLists, Scanner, String, Wrapper classes, and Exceptions).
- Object-Oriented Programming: We'll explore the OO programming paradigm by organizing our code into instantiable classes, and relating those classes to other classes using inheritance, interfaces, and generics.  Through this exploration, we'll deepen our understanding of the benefits associated with encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.  We'll also make use of object diagrams and pay close attention to the underlying representations of these objects in memory.
